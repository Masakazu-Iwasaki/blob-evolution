# blob-evolution
A simple evolution simulation. Blobs feel a force towards smaller blobs and away from bigger blobs. When they get big enough, they split into two smaller blobs with slightly mutated DNA. The DNA of each blob contain the weights of the forces, the distance a blob can 'see' and the size at which a blob will split. The color of each blob depends on the paramaters in the blob's DNA.
